Initialising applies certain configs
that are prerequisites in a Git repository.



One useful service that the staging area wouuld offer that I can
think of is when I have to save multiple number of files in one commit 
I can make a kind of final draft before the commit.It would add a 
certain degree of latitude,I guess.
