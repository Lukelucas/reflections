Initialising applies certain configs
that are prerequisites in a Git repository.



One useful service that the staging area wouuld offer that I can
think of is when I have to save multiple number of files in one commit

Branches are helpful when I want to experiment or try out 
different things.I can create branches of the code written so far 
and implement variations in the branches.


The tree structure makes the entire picture clear
and offers great help when I want to navigate between commits.


Merging different branches can be helpful if in my project I want 
to add certain features which somebody else might have come up with
in her code when she was working on ,say, a similar project.



Though automerging has its pros its always preferable
to let the user make the decision when there is similarity in code.
