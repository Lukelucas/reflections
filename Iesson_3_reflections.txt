I would use Gitthub to make changes to my repository,say when I am out and suddenly something strikes me.I wouldn't always be 
carrying my laptop with me.And the computer that I have access to might not be having Git on it. 



I would always prefer to pull changes manually because I wouldn't want changes made by someone else
to alter my code without my permission.


I would use clone when I want to import a repository to my machine and work locally.
I'd use fork when I'd want to make changes to data in someone's repository but I do not 
wish to contribute to his repository.
Branches are when I want to produce a variation of my own,say, code.
